;; args is the parameter specification to defmix
;; There are three kinds of parameters, required, optional, and options
;; Group them into a plist of lists keyed with :req :optional :rule

#|
 take arg specification to defmix and analyze it a bit. If an element is
 symbol -- required arg
 list  -- first element must be symbol that will be bound for required arg
      remaining args are keys :keyn
      :o optional arg
      :oo collect remaining args in list of optional args
      :r   rule
     The arg name (first elmt) and :o,:oo,:r are stripped from list and remaining
     keys are interpreted as names of tests that the arg must pass at call time.
     They are collected along with the argument position (argc '(remaining keys))
     and these in turn are collected in a list that is put in the plist under
     :arg-tests. This list of argument-position and arg-test pairs is passed at
     call time to an argument checking routine.

;; Define a maxima function via defmspec, but add some code to control evaluation
;; check number of args, etc., in a way similar to Mma.
;; For instance, usually, instead of an error, Mma prints a message and returns
;; the unevaluated form (but with args evaluated according to specification).
;; If desired, we could have a globabl flag to call merror instead.
;; Currently try to evaluate an arg either zero or once according to spec; again,
;; we might experiment with a flag that causes eval loop to a fixed point as in Mma.
;; Ex:   (defmix |$SomeFunc| ( a b (:o c) (:o d) )  body-form1 body-form2 ... )
;; where (:o c) means c is optional.
;; Arg spec (:oo e) collects rest of args in list e (via &rest)
;; Two local lexical bindings are created, mix-call and mix-call-args
;; which are available in the funciton body if needed. But the destructuring of mix-call-args
;; is done automatically by the macro. Seems perhaps a bit convoluted. But the
;; Mma-style arg checking is done first and the input form is returned on failure as Mma does.
;; Currently only number-of-arg checking is done, although mixima-check-args already has
;; some other stuff.
;; Eg, need to add :pos-spec-n , as used in MapAt
;; Note: defmfun's can be called directly (|$Sfun| .... ) while
;;  defmspec's must be called via (mfuncall |$Sfun| .... )
;;  I don't understand the difference between these two. But replacing defmfun with defmix
;;  causes at least this problem.
