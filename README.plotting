I have always found plotting cumbersome and difficult with
Mathematica, so I am inclined to use native Maxima plotting
(ie the interface to gnuplot) rather than implement Mma plotting
in Maxima. Only the following is done.

Mma Plot simply shadows Maxima plot2d, which means only
basic things work. Eg.

Plot(f(x),[x,a,b]);
Plot(f,[x,a,b]); /* if f(x) is defined */
Plot([f,g,h] ,[x,a,b]);

None of the options or other kinds of plots are implemented.
Plotting currently is not tested via rtest_...
