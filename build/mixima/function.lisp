  Mma pure functions. This is highly suboptimal. But it seems to be working.
  Most of the complexity and inefficiency comes from splicing SlotSequence.
  Not sure how to handle this.

  We can't just build the body of the lambda function using any lisp that computes
  the correct result. This is because the evaluator gets inside and errors occur when
  it fails to find maxima expressions. Same with printing the lambda function, this
  can cause crashes. Eg $mix_nth is used because of this.

  Implemented: 
   Function[{x,y} , x+y]
   Function[x , x^2]  same as    Function[{x} , x^2]

   #, #1 which are Slot(1)
   #2,  Slot(2)
   ##n  , SlotSequence(n)
   ##1 same as ##

   Here, we don't use # or ##, only Slot(n) and SlotSequence(n)

  #0 & "whole function" is not implemented

  Named args, ie Function[{x,y} , x+y] are implemented.
    How to distinguish one
    from the other? Looks like normally, Function with named args has two two
    args (arglist and body), while with Slot args there is only one arg to Function,
    the body. You can actually do hybrid, undocumented things in Mma , which we don't
    try to do here.

  Note the translator fails with  Function[x,x^2] [a],
  Translator should detect this and add mqapply.

  Still need to use gensym to protect name collision with mixima_lambda_args.

  Also, we use destructive replacement which could cause bugs.

#| ---------------------

The code here almost works. Only SlotSequence is
not spliced in properly. Too bad, its quite simple.
 
(defvar *mix-fun-par* nil)

(defmspec |$Function| ( x &aux callargs )
  (setf callargs (rest x))
  (let ( *mix-fun-par* )
    (cons '(lambda simp) (cons '((mlist) ((mlist) *mix-fun-par*)) callargs))))

(defun |$Slot| (n)
  (nth n *mix-fun-par*))

(defun |$SlotSequence| (n)
  *mix-fun-par*)
