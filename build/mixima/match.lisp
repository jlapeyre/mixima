;;; definition: a patternobject is like an expression but it can
;;; have (Pattern ...) or (Blank ..) subexpressions in it.

;;; All that matches in version 16
;;; (a) structurally identical matches.
;;; (b) (Blank) matches <anything>
;;;     (Blank foo) matches anything with a car of foo or
;;;     in the case of a match to an atom x, it will match
;;;     if (typep x foo) is true, foo is in {Integer, Rational ..?}

;;; (c) (Pattern x <patternobject>) matches whatever would
;;;   otherwise be matched by <patternobject> but  binds the value of
;;;   patternobject to the name x.  From that time onward during the match
;;;   x will only match identical items.

;;; That is, f[x_,x_] will match f[3,3] but not f[3,4].
;;; f[x_,x_^2] will match f[a,a^2].  But not f[3,9]. (sorry).

;;; (d)  (BlankSequence ...) or __ inside (non-Orderless) functions. Note:
;;;  If f is "Flat" then f[a,x_] matches f[a,z,w]
;;;   with x-> f[z,w]. 
;;;  If f is "Flat" then f[b,x__] matches f[b,z,w]
;;;   with x-> (z,w) .  That's Sequence[z,w]. Look it up...

;;; (e) (BlankNullSequence ...) or ___ inside (non-Orderless) functions.

;;; (f) Orderless functions are matched only if they have a fixed
;;; number of arguments.

;;; (g) (PatternTest <patternobj> Test) matches whatever <patternobj> would
;;; match, but only if (Test <patternobj>) returns lisp t.  Question:
;;; perhaps we should ask that (meval (list Test <patternobj>)) be True not t?
;;; we keep to t.

;;; g[x__,x__] matches g[1,2,3,1,2,3]  with x->(1,2,3)

;;; Some Flat functions are Plus, |Times|.  There are hardly any
;;; others.  Plus is also orderless (see below) complicating
;;; the matching considerably.  

;;; Functions which are both Flat and Orderless functions are
;;; not handled by this version.


;;; Orderless is handled...  (not, "If you can't eat it all, order less"  but
;;; "The universe tends toward a state without order -- orderless"..)

;;; if (say) Plus is orderless, then Plus[x_,Sin[x_]] matches
;;; Plus[3,Sin[3]] or Plus[Sin[3],3].

;;; Also allowed: x_Integer, x_foo,  or x:f[_] .   The form x_foo has the
;;; meaning that x's Head must be foo, or x must be of type foo.
;;;  x_foo parses into (Pattern x (Blank foo))
;;; x:f[_] parses into (Pattern x (f (Blank)))

;;; Return value for a match is  nil or non-nil.
;;; If the value is non-nil, the stack structure env
;;; will have a set
;;; of bindings of all the pattern-variable bindings. If the return value
;;; is nil, env will be unchanged.

;; define match stack, using up to 100 pattern variables if no-one else
;; has done it.

;; were stored, and frankly, defining map-over-args as mapcar and
;; (head x) as (car x) gets tiresome, especially when you "pun" and
;; use argument lists as lisp lists. Of course, if we change the
;; data representation, this program will be harder to change as a
