mma-to-mixima.lisp --
   read eval print loop (repl) for mockmma shell used with mixima compatibility
   functions. entermma is the entry point, which is wrapped in a maxima function
   tomma. Also reading from string and file supported.
   
pf.lisp    -- BuildFormat converts internal form of mma expressions
              to another lisp-like description of how to print it
disp1.lisp -- disp takes description returned by BuildFormat and builds
              and prints a string in the standard Mma print form.

eval.lisp  -- original repl for mockmma... hmmm ... already modified by Lapeyre. It
              looks like it was by Richard Fateman and then
              modified by Hunter Monroe.
