;; Mathematica, on which this is based,

;; this line is not quite enough. Need to do, prior to compiling this

;; ok, I give up.  I will use CL standard losing case insensitivity.
;; Allegro had it right prior to the standard, but had to yield. The
;; result, that the case-sensitive stuff did not always work in later
;; releases, seems to  makes it advisable to just use case-insensitive-upper.
;; it also increases compatibility with other CLs  RJF. 10/30/97
