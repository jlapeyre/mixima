Version 0.25
	* Added If(),List(),Attributes()
	* defmix lisp macro for writing compat funcs. major improvement.
	  This includes many kinds of automatic arg checking. Evaluation control, etc.
	* added declaring arrays to translator
	* application strongdeco improvements.
        * pure functions with Function. more features implemented. SlotSequence(n),Slot(n)
	  This still is inefficient and not fully implemented.
	* lisp macro multi-do for nested loops of arbitrary depth. all compat funcs with
	  loops of this kind now use this macro.
        * Array() takes head argument
	* ConstantArray() fixed
	* fixed some small bugs for Win32
	* one folder to copy for Win32 install
	
Version 0.24
	* added MapAt
	* added our own autoloading of share packages to speed up startup
	* got mockmma working, at least partially
	* implemented Part (mixpart, smixpart) with negative indices
	* For,While,Continue,Break,Return.
	* initial systematic arg checking.
        * lots of other improvements and changes.
