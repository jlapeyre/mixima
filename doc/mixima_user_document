Mixima User Document

This document contains more detailed information than the Readme

* The following global variables are set in mixima_func.mac in order
to emulate Mma more closely.

 simpsum:true; /* So that Sum does symbolic sums by default */
 simpproduct:true;
 expand_hypergeometric : true;
 logexpand:false;

* NIntegrate

  This makes calls to the maxima quadpack and romberg routines.
  Multiple integrals are implemented automatically as in Mma, but via nesting, which is slow.
  Details of the call are different from Mma.  Here is an example call

  NIntegrate(sin(sin(x)),[x,0,2], Rule(Method,NewtonCotesRule),
    Rule(MinRecursion,2),Rule(MaxRecursion,12),Rule(PrecisionGoal,10),Rule(AccuracyGoal,Infinity);

  Specifiying the Rules is optional.
  Method   can be one of Automatic NewtonCotesRule=RombergRule QagsRule Oscillatory=GaussKronrodRule6
       GaussKronrod=GaussKronrodRule=GaussKronrodRule1 GaussKronrodRule2 GaussKronrodRule3 GaussKronrodRule4
       GaussKronrodRule5

  Some rules are duplicated for deprecated Mma
  options. Here, the Rule Oscillatory does not work with
  infinite intervals, whereas in Mma 3.0 it *only* works
  with infinite intervals

  The default Method is Automatic which makes a few tests to choose a method. It is a good start,
  but needs improvment

  Other options are PrecisionGoal and AccuracyGoal. Options MinRecursion and MaxRecursion are only used
  with RombergRule method.
  See examples in tests/rtest_mixima_nintegrate.mac


* FindRoot

  With two boundary points, the secant method in maxima find_root is used.
  Examples:
  FindRoot(sin(x) = x/2,[ x, 0.1, %pi]);
  FindRoot(sin(x) - x/2,[ x, 0.1, %pi], Rule(PrecisionGoal,3), Rule(AccuracyGoal,10));
  FindRoot(sin(x) - x/2,[ x, 0.1, %pi]);

  With one starting point, Newton's method is used (using a modified version of the
  maxima function to include, for instance, a limit on the number of iterations).
  Examples:
  FindRoot(sin(x) = x/2,[ x, 1.0]);
  FindRoot(sin(x) = x/2,[ x, 1.0],Rule(MaxIterations,10));
  FindRoot(sin(x) - x/2,[ x, 1.0]);

  The options PrecisionGoal and AccuracyGoal are supported by the secant method.
  The options AccuracyGoal and MaxIterations are supported by Newton's method.	

  Note that in Newton's method AccuracyGoal determines how close the function evaluation
  must be to zero, not how close the variable will be to it's true value.
  Eg, the default AccuracyGoal is 6, but
  FindRoot(((Sin((x-10))-x)+10),[x,0]); gives 9.98318 .
  I more sophisticated stopping criterion ought to be used.

* Head

  If MiximaHeadStrict is true then Head returns Real for both floats and bfloats. Otherwise
  Head returns BFloat for bfloats. The default value of MiximaHeadStrict is true
