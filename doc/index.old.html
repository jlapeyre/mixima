<em> Mixima: Mathematica </em> to 
<em>Maxima</em> computer algebra system (CAS) translator and compatibility functions and 
 application to Quantum Information Programs </h2></center>

<h3> Version VERSIONNUMBER </h3>

Mixima is is a translator from the Mathematica language to the
Maxima language along with compatibility functions. The
translator currently handles a subset of the Mathematica
language. It handles some realistic code well, while other
code will require additional translation by hand.  These
compatibility functions are written for Maxima, but
approximate corresponding Mathematica functions.
<p>
The compatibility functions can be used without the translator, but
the converse is not true.
<p>
A translated application for doing quantum information calculations is included:

Here is <a href="./function_list.txt"> a list of compatibility functions </a>
To see how much functionality is implemented for some functions
see the <a href="rtest_mixima.txt"> test file </a>. (There are many other
regression tests as well.)
<p>

<p>

The compatibility functions are written in pure Maxima and lisp.
The translator is written in lisp and currently only works with Steel Bank
Lisp. Previous versions of the translator were written in  perl.
