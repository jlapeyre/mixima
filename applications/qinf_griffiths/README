------------------------------------------------------------
To use the Macsyma translation:
Install the compatibility functions as described in the distribution above.
Start maxima and load the code:

(%i1) load("mixima");
(%o1)                 /home/user/.maxima/mixima.mac
(%i2) load("./qinf050.mac");
(%o2)                            ./qinf050.mac

To test some of the routines with application code, start maxima and give these commands.
  load("mixima");
  batch("./rtest_qinf.mac",test);

An application of the Quantum Information Programs is in misc10.ma. The translation is
in rtest_misc10.mac formatted as a Maxima test. To run the test, enter Maxima and type

load("mixima");
batch("./rtest_misc10.mac",test);

Note for some of the above you may have to do load("./qinf050.mac") twice in a row.
Some of this code is slow. Compiling the code and/or the Mixima functions might help
quite a bit.

------------------------------------------------------------
Most of these files are intermediate files from the translation. They are useful for studying
the translation, but are not necessary for using the quantum information package.
Files:
qinf050.ma -- the original Mma source code to the software
qinf050_mod.m -- a few hand edits to qinf050.ma
             to allow the parser to read it, and to fix a 
             few small errors.
diff_qinf050_modqinf -- the difference between qinf050.ma and qinf050_mod.m
qinf050_mod_raw.mac -- raw output of translator mtrans on qinf050_mod.m
qinf050.mac -- raw output reformatted by function in reformat.lisp
qinf_byhand.mac -- file to be loaded afer qinf050.mac that fixes some
                  translation errors.
rtest_qinf.mac -- tests of qinf.mac (not complete!)
misc10.ma -- Some application code that uses qinf050.ma
misc10_raw.mac -- translation by mtrans
misc10_mod.mac -- hand edits to trim garbage, mistranlsations etc.
misc10_reformatted.mac -- reformatted by stringout(filename,input)
rtest_misc10.mac  -- test of translation of misc10
