 Efficiency: By default this is rather slow, as is seen by
 Laug(5);

 Compile and then load grobner, makes it much faster
 compile_file(file_search("grobner.lisp"),"./grob.o");
 load("./grob.o");
 
 Can also try lex or grlex here.
 poly_monomial_order: lex;

 Don't use Permanent defined in the strongdeco code. Use the mixima builtin,
 which calls the maxima builtin. It is much faster. Comment out or otherwise
 don't load the definition of Permanent in strongdeco.

The following are a sequence of files and what was done to go from mma text to working
code for the main function.

Strongdeco-tobias.txt -- exported text from Mma nb. Not in a very useful form.

strong_deco.m   --  copied functions mostly by hand into Mma 3.0 and did
  ? funcname and copied formatted  functions  back into this file. Added
   comment markers around free text.

strong_deco_nocomments.m -- should be about the same as above, but no comments.

   Note in the two previous files, some things were fixed by hand because they gave
   errors, Mma should have complained if it did not.

   zzz[a_, b_] := a^b , The colon was missing here.

   Also in this file, make sure there is a semi-colon after each definition. The parser
   may die otherwise. (No, this is mostly fixed.)

sd_raw.mac -- Do  mmatomax strong_deco_nocomments.m > sd_raw.mac

       In maxima batch-process the previous file  batch("./sd_raw.mac")$
       The print reformatted code to a file.
       newstringout("./sd_reform.mac", [1,10000],2);
       Finally, edit out the lines giving the batch command, etc.

sd_reform_fix.mac  -- copy of sd_raw.mac with hand fixes. Put in by hand fixes
     for Pots that are discussed elsewhere. add simpproduct:true to start of file.
     (In the mean time, we added/modded some functions in the compatibility functions
     in order to get things to work.
     Loading this file and running LaugDeco(3) or 4 or 5 gives correct results. But some other
     functions are broken still.

     This gives the correct result, for instance.
     rootscontract( LaugDeco(3) );

Some of the other functions are working as well, but it is not organized yet...
