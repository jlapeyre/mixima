Extra notes on compatibility functions.
The README contains more information.

Np() -- This function is not an Mma function.
  Np(expr,n) converts  expr to a number with
  n digits of precision and prints it to that precision.
  N(expr,n) also exists and it returns a number with
  the required precision. But the standard command line
  print loop does not print them all unless fpprintprec
  is set large enough.  This is a workaround to this
  difference in how Mma and maxima work.
